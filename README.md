# CN MATLAB Assignment

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for a cellular network simulation used in the Computer Networks course (Module 2). The main entry point is `run_assignment.m` which demonstrates several schedulers and generates various plots required by the assignment.

## Files

- `simulateScheduler.m` – core function implementing a simple PFRS scheduler with options for modifications and minimum-rate enforcement.
- `run_assignment.m` – example script that runs all required scenarios and produces the requested graphs.

## Usage

Open MATLAB in this directory and run:

```matlab
run run_assignment
```

The script will execute simulations for different configurations and display the graphs.
